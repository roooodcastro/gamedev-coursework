# Computer Games Development Coursework

#### Simple 3D game developed for a university coursework

### TODO List:

* Add other types of light source
* Create static colour textures (basically a texture colour palette)
* Review all classes and fix them to make sure they are RAII compliant
* Collision detection
* Stabilize framerate and tickrate
* Read audio files
* Implement sound playback
* Implement music playback and control
* Actually building a game on top of this engine
* Fix the mouse positioning for rotated interface items
* Design a fiel format and parse it to store track pieces configurations
* Finish implementing TrackPiece
* Implement Track
* Add audio to door closing animation
* Update door and track piece models to allow for UV mapping
* Create textures for doors and track pieces
* Implement ship physics and movement
* Implement joystick events
* Refactor ship's input handling to allow control via both keyboard and joystick
* Implement configuration manager
* Create a main menu screen
* Create a configuration screen
* Create a pause menu
* Create a credits screen
* Create a end game screen
* Create a tutorial/controls screen
* Implement upgrades or powerups


### Done:

* SDL Integration with OpenGL
* Basic framerate and tickrate control
* Level class
* User Interface class
* Some interface items
* Rendering of text
* Rendering of 2D elements (interface)
* Basic debug info (fps counter)
* Material file (.mtl) loader
* Wavefront file (.obj) loader
* Keyboard and mouse handling
* Basic shader pipeline
* Multiple source lighting
